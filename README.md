# Introduction



![biota&apos;s logo](.gitbook/assets/logo_and_name.png)

Biota is a framework that can scaffolds your app database within [FaunaDB ](https://fauna.com/)in 30s. It's fully hosted by Fauna in [User-Defined Functions](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/functions) \(also called **UDFs**\) which you get when you [install any of biota's modules](quickstart-guides/host-biota-in-fauna.md).

I would recommend starting with[ some tutorials](quickstart-guides/tutorials/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Biota is **not** affiliated with **FaunaDB**'s company. The project is welcomed by the team though.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Biota is **free** to use under MIT licensing.  
Consider supporting the project to see it grow bug-free.
