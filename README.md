# Introduction



![biota&apos;s logo](.gitbook/assets/logo_and_name.png)

Biota is a framework that lets you scaffold your app database within [FaunaDB ](https://fauna.com/)in **30s**. It's fully hosted by Fauna in [User-Defined Functions](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/functions) \(also called **UDFs**\) which you get when you [install any of biota's modules](quickstart-guides/host-biota-in-fauna.md).

_Right now this documentation is pretty empty. Content is coming!_

In the meantime you can go check out the [**sandbox!**](https://sandbox.biota.rocks)\*\*\*\*

{% hint style="info" %}
Biota is **not** affiliated with **FaunaDB** itself. The project is welcomed by the team though.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Biota is a **free** open source project.
